# Deployment

- CI/CD is currently made with Github Actions and it is docker based.
- If you don't want a specific action it can be [disabled](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow).

## Heroku

When the repository is first uploaded,
- It will build a Docker image and push it to Github Container registry
- The Github Action workflow will fail on the first run since we don't have the app created.

Needed dependencies
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli)
